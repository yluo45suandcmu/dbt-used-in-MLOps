This project utilizes the power of dbt (Data Build Tool) alongside DuckDB to transform, clean, and aggregate raw data into a polished dataset, ready for machine learning model training.

In the world of machine learning, the quality of your data sets the foundation for the success of your models. With this project, it demonstrate how to leverage modern data engineering tools to prepare data that's not just clean but also structured in a way that enhances the performance of your machine learning algorithms.
